In my first homework for my "Math for Data Science" class, I was tasked with performing simple and multiple linear regression on the "Auto" dataset. 
I also performed some simple feature engineering on a toy datatable to see how much better linear regression performs when taking the square of a feature 
into account for predicting a noisy linear pattern.
